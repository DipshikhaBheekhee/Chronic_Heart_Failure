🩺 Chronic Heart Failure Daily Weight and Symptom Tracker Chatbot Scenario Package

📖 Scenario Background

In Halifax, Nova Scotia, chronic heart failure is a common condition requiring careful daily monitoring. Patients are advised to track weight changes and symptoms to detect fluid retention early, helping prevent hospital admissions. Nova Scotia Health and national cardiac organizations provide clear patient education on daily weight monitoring, symptom tracking, and warning signs for decompensation. This scenario asks students to use the **Ollama \+ AnythingLLM** stack, combined with locally available, authoritative health education materials, to design a chatbot for **Chronic Heart Failure Daily Weight and Symptom Tracking**. 

🎯 Scenario Goals

Help users record and interpret daily weight changes Guide users in recognizing warning signs of worsening heart failure Clearly communicate that the chatbot does **not** provide professional medical diagnoses

🗂 Recommended Knowledge Base Materials Students should collect and organize **retrievable, structured** local health education materials to serve as their RAG knowledge base. Recommended sources include: Heart Failure Society of Canada – Patient Self-Management Handouts Nova Scotia Health – Daily Weight Tracking Guides Heart & Stroke Foundation – Warning Signs and Lifestyle Tips Patient-Friendly Symptom Checklists Any relevant local clinic or public health resources

📌 **Requirement:** Upload as PDF, Markdown, or plain text, using general, consistent file names such as:

knowledge\_document\_1.pdf

knowledge\_document\_2.md

knowledge\_document\_3.txt

🎯 Suggested User Questions for Testing Your final system must be able to answer these scenario questions using your uploaded knowledge base materials:

**Question 1:** "My weight went up 2 kilos in two days—should I call my doctor?" 

**Question 2:** "How can I tell if my leg swelling is serious?"
